# startup-website

##### Startup-website is a clone project inspired by https://www.czechcrunchshine.cz/ 

##### Special thanks to [Jan Losert](https://www.janlosert.com/) for letting me use his design on this project &nbsp;

###### Since it is a clone project and there is no commercial purpose, I changed some texts and images. &nbsp;


##### Here is the original design : [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/9063567-Beforeyoushine-com-Youtube-Course)
